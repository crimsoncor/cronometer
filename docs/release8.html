<h3>USDA sr19</h3>
The USDA food database has been upgraded to the most recent release. 
In addition to adding and updating many foods with more recent data,
CRON-o-Meter now adds data for Choline, Caffeine, and Fluoride. Note
that data for Choline and Fluoride may be under-represented in the data.
Some foods that existed in sr18 have been deleted in sr19. We've kept
these foods for backwards compatibility, but they will show up in the
program greyed-out with accomanying warnings.

<h3>Update CRDB</h3>
The special CRDB (CR Community Food Database) has been updated with new data
for <i>Brewer's Yeast Lewis Labs</i>. The USDA's entry for Almond Butter, Unsalted
is missing data for Vitamin E. A corrected entry was added to the CRDB. We've added 
several new foods submitted by Michael Rae. As always, we welcome quality submissions
from our user community for inclusion in the next release. 

<h3>Nutrient Editors</h3>
In the food editor, there is now a distinction made between a nutrient having a 
known amount of 0 and missing data. Nutrients with no data are shown in grey.
