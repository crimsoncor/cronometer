<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
 
This section answers some frequently-asked questions.
  
<h4>Does CRON-o-Meter support multiple users?</h4>
All modern operating systems, and CRON-o-Meter only runs on "modern" operating systems, have multiple user 
support which allows users to have separate accounts and log-ins. CRON-o-Meter stores the user settings in the 
appropriate location for the currently logged on user.  If you share a computer, you should use the 
built-in accounts and fast user switching features of your operating system.
<p>
However, if you pass a single command line parameter to CRON-o-Meter, it will create or load 
a profile by that name.  In this way, it is possible to manage multiple users under a single 
account of an operating system, but 
more than one profile cannot be opened simultaneously, and 
CRON-o-Meter does not display the profile name anywhere.
<p>
The following example would load or create the profile named "John" instead of the default.
<blockquote>
<tt>
./CRON-O-METER.exe John
</tt>
</blockquote>
For the Windows Operating System this would be: 
<blockquote>
<tt>
cd C:\Program Files\CRON-O-METER\<br>
CRON-O-METER.exe John
</tt>
</blockquote>
Each profile is kept as a folder that contains a separate set of user information, targets, personal 
recipes, and records of consumption.  The profiles are saved and maintained under the account owners 
Application Data folder, e.g.:
Default profile: 
<blockquote>
<tt>
C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Application Data\cronometer
</tt>
</blockquote>
Named Profile:
<blockquote>

<tt>
C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Application Data\John
</tt>
</blockquote>

<h4>One of the foods has an error in the nutrients, what should I do?</h4> 
CRON-o-Meter has 3 databases: 
<ul>
  <li><b>My Foods</b> which is your personal food list with the nutrition information
   that you have provided</li>
	<li><b>CRDB</b> which contains some foods frequently used by CRONies with the nutrition data originally
	provided by the contributors 
 </li>
 <li><b>USDA</b> which is the nutrition database provided by 
	the <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/" target="_blank">USDA</a>.</li>
</ul> 
 
We recently learned that unsalted almond butter (USDA 12195) had a Vitamin E amount zero,
whereas salted almond butter (USDA 12695) had the correct amount of Vitamin E. 
Inconsistencies in the USDA database may eventually be corrected by the government, but by editing the data
yourself, you can use more accurate data immediately.
Any deficiencies in the databases can be corrected by editing the food, saving it in "My Foods",
and then using the edited food in your recipes or daily menus.

<h4>I recently got a new computer.  How do I transfer my CRON-o-Meter data to the new computer?</h4>
For MS Windows, the default profile for CRON-o-Meter is located in a
folder called "cronometer" at:
<blockquote>
<tt>C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Application Data\cronometer</tt>
</blockquote>

Where "Owner" is your logon ID name, e.g., "John Smith".
<p>
The "Application Data" folder is a system folder that will not be
visible unless you specify that hidden files and folders should be
displayed. You can do this from the "Tools" function in the menu bar
of a window.

<blockquote>
<pre>
Tools->Folder Options->View
  Advanced settings:
   Hidden files and folders:
    o Show hidden files and folders 
</pre>
</blockquote>
 
Just copy the "cronometer" folder from the old computer to the corresponding location in the new computer and
you are set. The process is similar for other operating systems.
