<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
 
This section answers some frequently-asked questions.
   
 
<h4>One of the foods has an error in the nutrients, what should I do?</h4> 
CRON-o-Meter has 3 databases: 
<ul>
  <li><b>My Foods</b> which is your personal food list with the nutrition information
   that you have provided</li>
	<li><b>CRDB</b> which contains some foods frequently used by CRONies with the nutrition data originally
	provided by the contributors 
 </li>
 <li><b>USDA</b> which is the nutrition database provided by 
	the <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/" target="_blank">USDA</a>.</li>
</ul> 
 
We recently learned that unsalted almond butter (USDA 12195) had a Vitamin E amount zero,
whereas salted almond butter (USDA 12695) had the correct amount of Vitamin E. 
Inconsistencies in the USDA database may eventually be corrected by the government, but by editing the data
yourself, you can use more accurate data immediately.
Any deficiencies in the databases can be corrected by editing the food, saving it in "My Foods",
and then using the edited food in your recipes or daily menus.

<h4>I recently got a new computer.  How do I transfer my CRON-o-Meter data to the new computer?</h4>
For MS Windows, the default profile for CRON-o-Meter is located in a
folder called "cronometer" at:
<blockquote>
<tt>C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Application Data\cronometer</tt>
</blockquote>

Where "Owner" is your logon ID name, e.g., "John Smith".
<p>
The "Application Data" folder is a system folder that will not be
visible unless you specify that hidden files and folders should be
displayed. You can do this from the "Tools" function in the menu bar
of a window.

<blockquote>
<pre>
Tools->Folder Options->View
  Advanced settings:
   Hidden files and folders:
    o Show hidden files and folders 
</pre>
</blockquote>
 
Just copy the "cronometer" folder from the old computer to the corresponding location in the new computer,
install CRON-o-Meter from the web on your new computer, and
you are set. The process is similar for other operating systems.
