<h2>Limitations</h2> 

<div id="alert">
The developers of this software accept no liability in the use of this software. 
Use at your own risk. It is up to you to understand the risks and limitations of
the software.
</div>
<p>
Be careful before drawing conclusions from your nutritional summaries. 
Always consult your physician before making significant changes to
your diet or supplementation. 
 
<h4>Nutriton Data</h4> 
The results displayed are only as good as the data the program has for 
the various foods you enter. In many cases the data may be incomplete, incorrect, or 
simply different (was the apple you ate grown in different soil than the ones studied 
for the data?). 
<p>
The data displayed in this software should always be treated as
a rough estimate.  The data itself may contain
errors or be incomplete. The USDA food database, for instance,
contains average values for most foods. Local soil and growing 
conditions can deviate largely from the average values. 

<h4>Underrepresented Nutrients</h4> 

Some nutrients are underrepresented in the database because not every
food item has undergone comprehensive analysis.  In particular, Fluoride, 
Choline, and Vitamin D are significantly lacking data. 
<p>
For instance, values for Vitamin D are missing for many foods in the USDA nutrition
data. Of the 7293 foods listed, only 510 have values for Vitamin D. So if you appear 
chronically low on Vitamin D, it may be due to lack of data, not an actual deficiency 
in your diet! 

<h4>Software Bugs</h4> 

This software may contain unknown bugs that affect the reported values.
While we strive to ensure quality, the possibility of errors remains.
