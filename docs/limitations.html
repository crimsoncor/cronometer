<p>The data displayed in this software should always be treated as
a rough estimate.  The data itself may contain
errors or be incomplete. The USDA food database, for instance,
contains average values for most foods. Local soil and growing 
conditions can deviate largely from the average values. Some
nutrients are underrepresented in the database because not every
food item has undergone comprehensive analysis. 
Furthermore, this software may contain unknown bugs that affect
the reported values. You should not use this 
program to make life-critical decisions. </p>
