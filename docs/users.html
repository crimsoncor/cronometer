<h2>Managing users</h2>
<p>In CRON-o-Meter you can track multiple users diets in the same session. CRON-o-Meter will
track your food servings, biomarkers, notes, dietary targets and body profile separately.  It is possible
to copy selected foods from one person to another person and to a given date.  When you
add a food for one user, it will be available for all users in the system.  The name of the
currently selected user will be displayed in the title bar of the CRON-o-Meter window.  When
you exit CRON-o-Meter and restart it again another time, the last selected user will be
active.</p>

<p>You can find the user manager dialog in the File menu.  The user manager will allow you
to add a user or delete a user.  To switch between users click on the user you wish to
switch to, this will immediately update the servings list to reflect the new user.

<h2>Copy servings to another user</h2>
<p>Select the servings you wish to copy to another user, then from the "Edit" menu select 
"Copy To...".  You will be asked to select the user to copy the servings to and the date to which
where the copied servings should be placed.
