<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p align="justify">
The data displayed in this software should always be treated as
a rough estimate.  The data itself may contain
errors or be incomplete. The USDA food database, for instance,
contains average values for most foods. Local soil and growing 
conditions can deviate largely from the average values. Some
nutrients are underrepresented in the database because not every
food item has undergone comprehensive analysis. 
Furthermore, this software may contain unknown bugs that affect
the reported values. You should not use this 
program to make life-critical decisions.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p align="justify">
Download and execute the CRONOMETER setup program.  You can use the default installation directories, or 
choose your own.  If the program does not start after installation, the most likely cause
is that a Java environment needs to be enabled.</p>

<p align="justify">
The Java software can be downloaded free at:
<a href="http://www.java.com/en/">http://www.java.com/en/</a>.</p>

You can also manually select Java for various versions of Linux and Solaris at: 
<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Java support is built into Mac OS X, so there is no need to download Java on Apple computers.

<p align="justify">
<b>Updating Versions</b>.<br/>
When a new version of CRON-o-meter is available, just run the new setup program.
Any data that you previously entered will be retained.</p>

<h3>Program Functions</h3>

<p align="justify">
<b>Setting Nutritional Targets</b><br/>
The default nutritional values provided by CRON-o-meter are based on the official 
Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) set by the USDA.  You can change these values
to implement any diet.  Using the tabs, navigate to any
particular nutrient, double click on the value that you want to modify, and enter
a new value using the keyboard.  </p>
<img src="targets.png" width="589" height="434" title="" alt=""/>
<br/>

<p align="justify">
<b>Entering Daily Consumption</b><br/>
Select the date for which you want to enter your consumption.
Click on the "Add Serving" icon&nbsp;
<img src="addserving.png" width="92" height="19" title="" alt="" class="va-middle"/>&nbsp;
to open a dialog box with the food database.</p>
<img src="daily.png" width="266" height="183" title="" alt=""/>
<p align="justify">
Search the data base for the foods that you consume, select by clicking the appropriate entry,
and then click the "Add" button.  For example, suppose that you ate a McDonald's Big Mac for lunch.
When you search for "mcdonald's", there will be a list of McDonald's products.  Click once on 
"McDONALD'S, BIG MAC" (Don't double click because that will bring the food editing panel).
Click on the portion size pull-down menu which will display "g" (gram) or "item".  Select "item", 
and then click the "Add" button.  The food will be added to the right side of the screen
for the corresponding day.</p>

<img src="addfood.png" width="536" height="322" alt="Add food"/>
<p align="justify">
The distribution of macronutrients relative to the targets is immediately displayed in the
colorful bars and the pie-chart of the summary.   The numbers in parentheses give you the
percentages of your daily targets.  You can then say: "Wow! 51% of the calories of a Big Mac
come from fat!!!" (the red part of the circle). 
Hopefully, you can make better choices for the 
rest of the day.  CRON-o-meter will help to keep you on track.</p>

<p align="justify">
Notice that the percentages on the bar chart for Protein, Carbohydrates, and Lipids
are the percentages of the gram amounts, whereas the pie-chart represents the percentages
of the total calories for each of these macronutrients.</p>
<br/>

<img src="summary1.png" width="421" height="425" alt="Summary"/><br/>

<p align="justify">
<b>Creating a Food</b><br/>
Because of the large number of food products available to consumers, it is very likely that
you use a food that is not listed in the database.  In this case, you will need to create a 
new food.  You can use the "Food&rarr;Create New Food" function on the Menu Bar, or if there is something similar in the 
database, you can export it and then import it, rename it, and edit it.  Basically, you need
to specify the name of the food, the quantity for which you have nutritional data, and then
enter the detailed quantity of nutrients under each of the tabs below.</p>

<img src="nutrition.png" width="279" height="26" alt="Nutrition tabs"/>

<p align="justify">
<b>Creating a Recipe</b><br/>
On the Menu Bar, click on "Food&rarr;Create New Recipe".  A dialog box enables you to 
name the recipe and specify ingredients and amounts.  Click on the "Add Serving" icon
<img src="addserving.png" width="92" height="19" title="" alt="" class="va-middle"/>.&nbsp;
This causes the "Select a Food" panel to display.  You can now type the name of 
the first food ingredient
for your recipe.  Select the ingredient by clicking on it, enter a weight, and click the "ADD"
button.  Repeat the procedure for each ingredient.  In the recipe, you can adjust the amount of 
each ingredient by double clicking the amount field and typing a new value.  
Similarly, by double clicking the calories, you can type a new number
and the weight will be adjusted accordingly.  
Foods may be removed from the recipe by clicking on them and then clicking on the trash can icon.
Click the "Save" button to save the recipe.</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>Importing a Food</b><br/>
Click on "Food&rarr;Import Food" function to display a file dialog panel.  Select the <i>.xml</i> file 
and click on the Open button.  The imported food will be placed in My Foods category.</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>Exporting a Food</b><br/>
This function provides a way of sharing your recipes by creating
a file with an <i>.xml</i> extension that can be sent to another CRON-o-meter user.
Click on the food to select it, and then click the Export Food icon <img src="export.png" width="22" height="18" title="" alt="" class="va-middle"/>, or
right click on the food that you want to export, and click the "Export Food" icon
from the pull-down menu that appears by the cursor.  The dialog box lets you specify the folder where you would
like to save the recipe or food.</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>Entering Biomarkers</b><br/>
Click on the "Biomarkers" tab for a specific date.  Click on the check box of the specific
biomarker that you want to track (Weight, Body Temperature, Systolic, or Diastolic Blood Pressure).
Enter a numeric value.  Note that there are no units associated with any of these biomarkers.
Therefore, you can enter your weight in pounds or kilograms, and your temperature in either Celsius or
Fahrenheit degrees.  Clicking on the corresponding chart button for each biomarker will display 
a graph of the variations over time.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p align="justify">
This software is made by an all-volunteer effort. If you want to chip in and
lend a hand there are lots of things you can do to improve the program. Besides
programmers, we could use:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Technical writing skills to make a user-friendly help manual</li>
 <li>Custom art work for icons and aesthetics</li>
 <li>Scientific accuracy -- help find errors, bugs, or improve the nutritional analysis</li>
 <li>A library of food entries that could be shared on the Internet by CRON-o-meter users</li>
</ul>
To report bugs use the "Help&rarr;Report a Bug" function on the menu bar.<br/>
