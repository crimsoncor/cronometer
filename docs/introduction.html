		 <p>
		  CRON-O-Meter is <b>free</b>, <b>open source</b>, and <b>cross-platform</b>
		  dieting software.  
		  <p>
		   CR (Calorie Reduced) diets require a lot of information to perform optimally.
		  In order to restrict caloric intake, but remain healthy, users of the diet must 
		  track their vitamin, mineral, and protein intakes with great care.
 		  <p>
		  We aim to provide a complete solution to the CR dieter. Current open-source diet-tracking 
		  applications fall short in some vital respects. Either they are not detailed enough, 
		  or they suffer from critical usability flaws. We believe that a diet tracker must be 
		  effortless to operate for the activity for which it will be used most of the time, 
		  keeping track of the foods eaten in a particular meal.
		  <p>
		  To this end, we are developing CRON-O-Meter, an application that will take into account
		  good usability design and dense functionality. It will provide diet advice, track 
		  consumption and exercise, and generally assist in all aspects of a CR diet.

<p>The data displayed in this software should always be treated as
a rough estimate.  The data itself may contain
errors or be incomplete. The USDA food database, for instance,
contains average values for most foods. Local soil and growing 
conditions can deviate largely from the average values. Some
nutrients are underrepresented in the database because not every
food item has undergone comprehensive analysis. 
Furthermore, this software may contain unknown bugs that affect
the reported values. You should not use this 
program to make life-critical decisions. </p>
