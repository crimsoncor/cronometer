		 <p>
		  CRON-O-Meter is <b>free</b>, <b>open source</b>, and <b>cross-platform</b>
		  dieting software.  
		  <p>
		   CR (Calorie Reduced) diets require a lot of information to perform optimally.
		  In order to restrict caloric intake, but remain healthy, users of the diet must 
		  track their vitamin, mineral, and protein intakes with great care.
 		  <p>
		  We aim to provide a complete solution to the CR dieter. Current open-source diet-tracking 
		  applications fall short in some vital respects. Either they are not detailed enough, 
		  or they suffer from critical usability flaws. We believe that a diet tracker must be 
		  effortless to operate for the activity for which it will be used most of the time, 
		  keeping track of the foods eaten in a particular meal.
		  <p>
		  To this end, we are developing CRON-O-Meter, an application that will take into account
		  good usability design and dense functionality. It will provide diet advice, track 
		  consumption and exercise, and generally assist in all aspects of a CR diet.
