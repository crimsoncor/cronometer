USDA sr19 deprecated some foods from USDAsr18. The foods have been kept for 
backwards compatibility, but it is recommend you no longer use them. They will 
show up as light grey in the search and food listings. These items were removed 
because either the nutritional data is considered out of date and/or the product
is no longer available on the market.
